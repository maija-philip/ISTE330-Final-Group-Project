# ISTE330-Final-Group-Project

Fall Semester 2022
2nd Year
ISTE 330 Database Connectivity and Access

This was a final group project with 5 people. This group project was a struggle 
because we realized on the day of the second deadline that only my group member
Thomas and I had completed our parts of the project. I had also completed my part
for the third deadline in anticipation of future projects around the third deadline.

We messaged our group and ended up having to finish the second deadline by ourselves
with a one day extension when we brought it up to the professor. One of our group
members realized that we brought it up with the professor and was challenging and
confrontational in our group discord, but was also unwilling to help us finish.

He ended up doing a small part of his portion for the third deadline which was a
nice help, but needed us to walk him through it.

I really enjoyed the type of project because it was creating a database and program
to allow users to work with the database. The group aspect was definitely a struggle,
and I believe it was the hardest group to work with I've had. Me and Thomas worked well
together and if I could do the project over again, I would have more communication with
the group durring the deadline 2 span to not only remind my group members of the 
upcomming due date, but also figuring out earlier that two of our group members essentially
dropped our group.
